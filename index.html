    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        I am an educator turned engineer, and have brought my love of learning
        into the development world. I enjoy asking questions, figuring out how
        things work, and fixing things, whether it's code or my camping equipment. When I am
        not solving puzzles I enjoy traveling with my wife and our dog.
